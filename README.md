The Simplex method is an approach to solving linear programming models by hand using slack variables, tableaus, and pivot variables as a means to finding the optimal solution of an optimization problem.  A linear program is a method of achieving the best outcome given a maximum or minimum equation with linear constraints.  Most linear programs can be solved using an online solver such as MatLab, but the Simplex method is a technique for solving linear programs by hand.  

●	Standard form
●	Introducing slack variables
●	Creating the tableau
●	Pivot variables
●	Creating a new tableau
●	Checking for optimality



This code breaks down the Simplex method into the above steps.
